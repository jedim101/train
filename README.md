# Train

This is the repo for my train files for arcade.
It contains the cad files and some videos of it in action. it is designed to be 3d printed. gcode files are included as well, sliced for Ender 3 V2 in PLA.

# Printing & Assembly

The `sliced` folder contains two file to print. They were sliced for Ender 3 V2. Use the `.stl` files in `CAD` to slice with different settings.
Print `Body.gcode` once and `Wheels.gcode` twice.

wheels should fit nicely onto axles, but may need to be superglued, depending on your printer & tolerances
