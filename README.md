# train

This is the repo for my train files for arcade.
It contains the cad files and some videos of it in action. it is designed to be 3d printed. gcode files are included as well, sliced for Ender 3 V2 in PLA.

The files with `Printable` in the name are the ones that should be 3d printed.

wheels may need to be superglued onto the axles, depending on your printer & tolerances
